Thanks to Danny for sharing this challenge. You can find the questions and schema used in [this link](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-4/).

## Business Task
A new innovation in the financial industry is called 'Neo-Banks', or digital-only banks without physical branches. Danny thought there should be some sort of intersection between these new banks and the data world, so he launched Data Bank, which not only offers banking activities but also provides the world's most secure distributed data storage platform. Customers are allocated cloud data storage limits directly linked to the amount held in their bank accounts.

Data Bank wants to increase their total customer base but also need help tracking how much data storage their customers will need.
