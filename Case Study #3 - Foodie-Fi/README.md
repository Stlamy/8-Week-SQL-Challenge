## Case Study Questions

### A. Customer Journey

**Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.**

````sql
SELECT 
	s.*
	, p.plan_name
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions s
LEFT JOIN foodie_fi.plans p
ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
WHERE customer_id = 1
	OR customer_id = 2 
  OR customer_id = 11
  OR customer_id = 13
  OR customer_id = 15
  OR customer_id = 16
  OR customer_id = 18
  OR customer_id = 19
ORDER BY customer_id, start_date;
````

#### Code Explanation
- A more elegant solution would be to use the 'IN' statement within the WHERE condition: 'IN (1, 2, 11, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19);'.


#### Answer

| customer_id | plan_id | start_date               | plan_name     |
| ----------- | ------- | ------------------------ | ------------- |
| 1           | 0       | 2020-08-01T00:00:00.000Z | trial         |

| 15          | 0       | 2020-03-17T00:00:00.000Z | trial         |
| 15          | 2       | 2020-03-24T00:00:00.000Z | pro monthly   |
| 15          | 4       | 2020-04-29T00:00:00.000Z | churn         |
| 16          | 0       | 2020-05-31T00:00:00.000Z | trial         |
| 16          | 1       | 2020-06-07T00:00:00.000Z | basic monthly |
| 16          | 3       | 2020-10-21T00:00:00.000Z | pro annual    |
| 18          | 0       | 2020-07-06T00:00:00.000Z | trial         |
| 18          | 2       | 2020-07-13T00:00:00.000Z | pro monthly   |

| 19          | 2       | 2020-06-29T00:00:00.000Z | pro monthly   |
| 19          | 3       | 2020-08-29T00:00:00.000Z | pro annual    |

From the resulting query, observe the onboarding journey for each customer:
- customer_id 1 - started with the 7 day free trial, then downgraded to the basic monthly plan.
- customer_id 2 - started with the 7 day free trial, then upgraded to the annual pro subscription.
- customer_id 11 - started with the 7 day free trial and chose to cancel their subscription to churn.
- customer_id 13 - started with the 7 day free trial, downgraded to the basic monthly, then upgraded back to the pro after over 3 months.
- customer_id 15 - started with the 7 day free trial and mantained their subscription, but then canceled after roughly one month.
- customer_id 16 - started with the 7 day free trial, downgraded to the basic monthly, then upgraded to the annual pro subscription after roughly one month.
- customer_id 18 - started with the 7 day free trial and maintained their subscription.
- customer_id 19 - started with the 7 day free trial, maintained their subscription, then upgraded to the annual pro plan after roughly 2 months.
